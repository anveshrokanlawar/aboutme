I am a new graduate student of Spring 2019 batch pursuing my Masters in Applied Computer Science at Northwest Missouri State University.

I'm from Hyderabad, India and completed my bachelors in Computer Science at Vardhaman college of Engineering Hyderabad. I do have a work experience of 1.5 yrs as a MS SQL Database Administrator at CTRLS Datacenter Hyderabad.

I feel this course will be the most logical extension to my industrial experience and help me in achieving my career objectives to become a Data Architect.
